### What I learned

I perfected the creation of elements in the DOM, working with the json given by the API. I learned how to properly reference elements in json, how to catch errors in axios, I used data destructuring. I learned at least in part how audio works in HTML5, although it is problematic. The code deviates strongly from the ideal, but I tried to write and think by myself, I believe that this is how I will learn the most.
I add commits to github to make version control easier, but I know I do it too infrequently, I'll try to improve that. In the next project I will try to work on separate branches to do merge afterwards

### Continued development

I need to improve the functioning of the audio because not every object has its own audio, I have a problem with the audio playback after entering a new input, the audio source would not overwrite, but only added a new source as a result two sounds played, I would like to fix this because the console still displays the error, but the end user does not see it.
